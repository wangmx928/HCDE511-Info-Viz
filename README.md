# HCDE511-Info-Viz
Information visualization for the US health insurance plans in 2020

This is the project done for the HCDE511 Information Visualization in the winter quarter 2020. This web application is built with Vue.js, Graphql, SQLite3, Nodejs, and Highcharts. The final implementation process took about one and half week together with the other course work. The team went through the whole process of user-centered design from ideation all the way to the final deliverable. Detailed visualization design was checked against Tufte's graphic excellence and integrity; interaction of the viz was assessed with Shneiderman's mantra. If there were more time, we would like to spend more time in refining the design, providing more user-interactions, and testing the web applciation more comprehensively. Due to the time limitation, this web app has only been tested on Chrome without responsive design.
